# Regression-Models-week-3-quiz

this repository consists of my analysis of tHE "data science practice":

Your assignment is to study how income varies across different categories of college majors. You will be using data from a study of recent college graduates. Make sure to use good practices that you have learned so far in this course and previous courses in the specialization.In particular, it is good practice to specify an analysis plan early in the process to avoid the “p-hacking” behavior of trying many analyses to find one that has desired results. If you want to learn more about “p-hacking”, you can visit

RESULTS: based on the analysis I performed, I can say, that there is no significant association between college major category and income
